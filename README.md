This repository will hold most of the links and materials to be used in the hands on session of the IUNI Workshop : An Introduction to Network Visualization. 

See https://iuni.iu.edu/news/event/79 for more info.

**The tutorial files will be uploaded a few hours before the workshop**

## Hands-on links and materials
The hands-on session is separated in three parts:
1. Standalone network visualization tools
2. Python libraries to handle and visualize networks
3. Interactive network visualization in the web

Except for part 1, some programming skills and knowledge on the involved technologies (Python for part 2 and Javascript/HTML for part 3) are recommend for anyone following following and reproducing the hands-on tutorials.


## Standalone tools
This session will cover some of the most used network visualization tools out there.
We recommend the attendants to pre-download and install these apps if they are available to their platforms.

 - [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org)
 - [Gephi](https://gephi.github.io)
 - [Graphia](https://graphia.app)

Please, follow the installation instructions in the website of each tool.

## Python libraries to handle and visualize networks
To follow this part of the presentation, we recommend the attendent to download this repository to their machines and prepare a python environment containing some packages related to network analysis and visualization.

To download this repository using the github web interface open this repository in a web browser and click on button *Code* and then *Download ZIP*

uncompress the file and move it to a directory with read/write permissions (like your user folder)

Alternativally you can use git to download. First make sure git is installed by running git command line in the shell or DOS/power-shell prompt. You can follow the [instalation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in case git failed to run. With git installed, run the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipinascimento/workshop-netviz.git
```
It should create a folder called workshop-netviz on the current directory.
